# Colorbar Generator Documentation

The code in this file was used once to generate an image of a colorbar, which is an asset that is used in the
website to aid in the visualization of certain numerical scores.
The code in this file is _NOT_ called when the dashboard is run.
This code has simply been included here for reference. It is not crucial to the functioning of the dashboard,
and <span style="color: red">can be safely deleted</span>.
